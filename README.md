# DataTalker
DataTalker is an intelligent, conversational agent designed to make data portals more accessible and useful through natural language interaction. Instead of navigating complex dashboards or filtering data through form-based interfaces, users can simply “talk” to DataTalker — describing what they’re looking for, asking questions, and iteratively refining their exploration.

While it integrates tightly with Open Government Data (OGP) Platform and India Data Portal (IDP), DataTalker is conceived as a standalone interface layer — capable of exposing existing features (like dataset discovery, filtering, and visualization) and introducing powerful new capabilities that are unique to the chatbot, such as data-driven research report generation, conversational summaries, and location-based comparisons.

DataTalker empowers a broad and diverse user base, including:
 - Policymakers and grassroots decision-makers
 - Researchers and students
 - Journalists and civil society actors
 - Curious citizens seeking actionable insights

## User Interaction Flows

| **Flow** | **Goal** | **User Input** | **DataTalker Response** |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Flow 1: Dataset Discovery** | User wants to find data related to agriculture in Punjab. | Show me datasets about agriculture in Punjab. | Okay, I found a few datasets related to agriculture in Punjab on the India Data Portal: <br> 1. Punjab Agricultural Census Data (2015-16): Contains data on land holdings, crops, and irrigation. <br> 2. Fertilizer Consumption in Punjab (2010-2020): Tracks NPK fertilizer usage by district. <br> 3. Punjab Crop Production Statistics (Annual): Data on yield for major crops like wheat and rice. <br> Would you like to know more about any of these, or perhaps search for something more specific? |
| **Flow 2: Specific Query & Basic Aggregation** | User wants to know the average wheat yield in Ludhiana district over the last 5 years, using data found in Flow 1. | Using dataset 3, what was the average wheat yield in Ludhiana for the last 5 years? | (Processes request: Filters dataset 3 for 'Wheat', 'Ludhiana', and the last 5 available years, then calculates the average yield) <br> Based on the Punjab Crop Production Statistics, the average wheat yield in Ludhiana district between [Year-5] and [Year-1] was approximately [X] tonnes per hectare. <br> Would you like to see the year-by-year breakdown? |
| **Flow 3: Visualization Request & Iterative Refinement** | User wants to visualize fertilizer consumption trends from Flow 1. | Can you show me the trend of fertilizer consumption in Punjab using dataset 2? | (Processes request: Identifies dataset 2, extracts relevant time-series data for overall Punjab consumption) <br> Okay, here is a line chart showing the total NPK fertilizer consumption in Punjab from 2010 to 2020: <br> [Displays a line chart showing Time vs. Total Consumption] |
| | | That's helpful. Can you break that down by fertilizer type (N, P, K)? | (Processes refinement: Uses the same dataset but aggregates by fertilizer type) <br> Sure. Here's the same trend, but broken down by Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) consumption: <br> [Displays a multi-line chart showing Time vs. Consumption, with separate lines for N, P, K] |
| **Flow 4: Summary Request** | User wants a quick summary of the Agricultural Census dataset found in Flow 1. | Give me a quick summary of dataset 1. | (Processes request: Accesses metadata and potentially key stats from dataset 1) <br> The Punjab Agricultural Census Data (2015-16) provides a snapshot of the agricultural landscape in Punjab. Key areas covered include the distribution of land holdings by size, major crops grown (like wheat and rice dominate), irrigation sources (e.g., tube wells, canals), and basic farmer demographics. It's useful for understanding the structure of agriculture in the state during that period. <br> Would you like to explore specific aspects, like land holding sizes or irrigation methods? |
| **Flow 5: Handling Ambiguity & Clarification** | User makes a vague request, and the bot asks for clarification. | Tell me about crops. | I can definitely help with information about crops! To give you the most relevant data, could you please specify: <br> - Are you interested in a specific region (e.g., a state or district)? <br> - Are you looking for production data, area under cultivation, or something else? <br> - Do you have a particular time period in mind? <br> For example, you could ask "Show me wheat production in Haryana for the last 3 years". |
| **Flow 6: Simple Report Generation Snippet** | User has explored data (like in Flows 2 & 3) and wants a small report section. | Okay, based on our discussion about wheat yield in Ludhiana and fertilizer trends, can you generate a short paragraph for a report? | (Processes request: Uses conversational context and retrieved data points/visuals) <br> Alright, here's a draft paragraph summarizing our findings: <br> "Analysis of recent agricultural data from the India Data Portal reveals key trends in Punjab. In Ludhiana district, the average wheat yield between [Year-5] and [Year-1] was approximately [X] tonnes per hectare (Source: Punjab Crop Production Statistics). Concurrently, statewide fertilizer consumption trends from 2010-2020 show [mention key trend from chart, e.g., a steady increase in Nitrogen use] (Source: Fertilizer Consumption in Punjab). Further investigation could explore potential correlations between specific input usage and crop yields at the district level. |
